## Process & Analyze data

here i am using google bigquery

## create a table and add all data to the new table

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `case-study-434613.Cyclistic.all_trip_data` AS
(
  SELECT * FROM `case-study-434613.Cyclistic.trip_2023_08`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `case-study-434613.Cyclistic.trip_2023_09`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `case-study-434613.Cyclistic.trip_2023_10`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `case-study-434613.Cyclistic.trip_2023_11`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `case-study-434613.Cyclistic.trip_2023_12`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `case-study-434613.Cyclistic.trip_2024_01`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `case-study-434613.Cyclistic.trip_2024_02`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `case-study-434613.Cyclistic.trip_2024_03`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `case-study-434613.Cyclistic.trip_2024_04`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `case-study-434613.Cyclistic.trip_2024_05`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `case-study-434613.Cyclistic.trip_2024_06`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `case-study-434613.Cyclistic.trip_2024_07`
);


## check for the number of data 
SELECT count(*)from `case-study-434613.Cyclistic.all_trip_data`;

## see the first 10 data in the table
SELECT * FROM `case-study-434613.Cyclistic.all_trip_data` LIMIT 10;

## checking the datatypes of the columns in table
SELECT column_name, data_type 
from `case-study-434613.Cyclistic.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`
where table_name='all_trip_data';

## delete duplicate ride_id
CREATE or REPLACE table `case-study-434613.Cyclistic.all_trip_data` as 
select distinct * from `case-study-434613.Cyclistic.all_trip_data`;

## check for null values
select * from `case-study-434613.Cyclistic.all_trip_data` where start_station_name is null or end_station_name is null;

## Analyze

## analyze the usage pattern of casual riders vs annual riders
select member_casual,count(ride_id) as ride_count from `case-study-434613.Cyclistic.all_trip_data` group by member_casual;

## calculate average ride duration for each group
select member_casual,avg(timestamp_diff(ended_at, started_at, minute))as avg_ride_duration 
from `case-study-434613.Cyclistic.all_trip_data` group by member_casual;

## identify most popular rides
select start_station_name, end_station_name, count(ride_id)as ride_count from `case-study-434613.Cyclistic.all_trip_data`
group by start_station_name, end_station_name order by ride_count desc;
